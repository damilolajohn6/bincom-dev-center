This program uses the BeautifulSoup library (bs4) to parse the HTML data. It finds the table body using soup.find('tbody') and then iterates over each row in the table using table_body.find_all('tr'). For each row, it extracts the color data from the <td> element and adds them to the colors list after splitting the data by commas and spaces.

Finally, the program calculates the variance of the colors using the statistics.variance() function, which takes the colors list as input.

Please make sure to install the BeautifulSoup library (pip install beautifulsoup4) and the statistics library is included with Python by default, so no additional installation is required before running the program.



Before running the program, you need to provide the appropriate values for the PostgreSQL connection parameters (host, database, user, and password). Also, make sure to install the BeautifulSoup (pip install beautifulsoup4) and psycopg2 (pip install psycopg2) libraries.

The program extracts the color data from the HTML using BeautifulSoup, calculates the frequency of each color, connects to the PostgreSQL database, creates a new table to store the colors and frequencies, and then inserts the data into the table.

Please adjust the connection parameters and table structure according to your PostgreSQL setup.
